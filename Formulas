-- Exploratory Data Analysis with Excel
-- Using Excel to analyze my friends' NBA bets

-- In order to make it easier to read, I'm replacing the original columns letters (e.g "A:A") by what the column means in square brackets (e.g: [Year]) 



---- FIRST HYPOTHESIS: Participants would make conservative bets in the first two rounds of the Playoffs and more audatious bet in the last two rounds

-- Creating columns to find if the bet was conservative:

[Conservative]
= IF([Bet_Games Won by Higher Ranked team] > [Bet_Games Won by Lower Ranked team], 1, 0)

[Conservative T/F]
= IF([Conservative] = 1; TRUE; FALSE)


-- Finding out conservative bets by year and round (e.g: first round from 2021 season):

[Conservative Bets Sum]
= SUMIF('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd"; [Conservative])


-- Counting ALL bets by year and round (e.g: first round from 2021 season)

[Bets count]
= COUNTIF('2021bets'![Round]'; "1st Rd")


-- Calculating conservative bets %:

[Conservative Bets %]
= ([Conservative bets Sum] * 100) / [Bets count]


-- RESULT: First hypothesis was wrong, participants would usually be conservative in all rounds (except for for the 2019 finals).



---- SECOND HYPOTHESIS: Conservative bets would usually pay off


-- Creating columns to find out it the bet was right about the winning team:

[Bet_Games Won Margin]
= [Bet_Games Won by Higher Ranked team] -  [Bet_Games Won by Lower Ranked team]

[Bet_Winning Team]
= IF([Bet_Games Won Margin] > 0; "Higher-Ranked Team"; "Lower-Ranked Team")


-- Bringing the results of the real games to from another table (with all the real life results) to this one:

[Real_Games Won Margin]
= VLOOKUP ([Series ID]; 'Real life Results Table'; [Games Won Difference]; 0)

[Real_Winning Team]
= IF([Real_Games Won Margin] > 0; "Higher-Ranked Team"; "Lower-Ranked Team")


-- Comparing colums:

[Bet was right]
= IF([Bet_Winning Team] = [Real_Winning Team]); 1; 0)

[Bet was right T/F]
= IF([Bet was right] = 1); TRUE; FALSE)


-- Finding out conservative bets that were RIGHT, by year and round (e.g: first round from 2021 season):

[Right Conservative Bets]
= SUMIFS('2021bets'![Bet was right]; [Round]; "1st Rd"; '2021bets'![Conservative]; "TRUE")


-- Finding out ALL the conservative bets by year and round (e.g: first round from 2021 season):

[Conservative Bets]
= COUNTIFS('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd"; '2021bets'![Conservative]; "TRUE")


-- Calculating % of the conservative bets that were right:

[Right Conservative Bets %]
= ([Right Conservative Bets] * 100) / [Conservative Bets]


-- RESULT: Second hypothesis was right, 76,6% of the conservative bets were right. Also, splitting that calculation by year and round may better show in which series the underdogs had a great performance.



---- THIRD HYPOTHESIS: Series results: in average, participants would bet that the series from the first two rounds would end with a 4-0 or a 4-1 result; The last two rounds would be in general 4-3 or 4-2.


-- In this case I wanted to test nested functions. Let's find the average bet of how many games the each team won in a series, by year and round (e.g: first round from 2021 season)

[Higher-Ranked Team, Average Games Won]
= SUMIF('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd";'2021bets'![Bet_Games Won by Higher Ranked team])
/ COUNTIF('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd")

[Lower-Ranked Team, Average Games Won]
= SUMIF('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd";'2021bets'![Bet_Games Won by Lower Ranked team])
/ COUNTIF('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd")


-- And, for the "Total" column that would sum data from the four years up, I decided to test even more functions in the same expression:

= ( SUMIF('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd";'2021bets'![Bet_Games Won by Lower Ranked team]) + 
SUMIF('2020bets'![Round]; "1st Rd";'2020bets'![Bet_Games Won by Lower Ranked team]) + 
SUMIF('2019bets'![Round]; "1st Rd";'2019bets'![Bet_Games Won by Lower Ranked team]) + 
SUMIF('2018bets'![Round]; "1st Rd";'2018bets'![Bet_Games Won by Lower Ranked team]) )
/ ( COUNTIF('2021bets'![Round]; "1st Rd") + 
COUNTIF('2020bets'![Round]; "1st Rd") + 
COUNTIF('2019bets'![Round]; "1st Rd") + 
COUNTIF('2018bets'![Round]; "1st Rd") )


-- RESULT: Inconclusive, as I could not see any pattern on the resulting data apart from some outliers.



-- In the [Participant Surname] column, I used this string manipulation to keep participants discrete and reveal only their surname:

[Participant Surname]
= RIGHT([Participant Full Name]; LEN([Participant Full Name]) - SEARCH(" "; [Participant Full Name]; 1))
