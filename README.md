**Gollnick's NBA Playoffs Predictions Game** was a betting game that I runned from 2018 to 2022 just for the sake of having a little bit of fun with my friends during the NBA playoffs. Betting was actually free and there was no prize money.

Usually, when each round of the NBA Playoffs began, I would send Google Forms to my friends where they could insert their predictions to each playoff series (say Toronto Raptors 4-2 Golden State Warriors). 
Those predictions were then compiled in spreadsheets that I used for this analysis.

In this study, I have used Excel formulas to analyze three hypothesis that I had:

1) Participants would make conservative* bets in the first two rounds of the Playoffs and more audatious bet in the last two rounds;
2) Conservative bets would usually pay off;
3) Series results: in average, participants would bet that the first two rounds would end with a 4-0 or a 4-1 result; The last two rounds would be in general 4-3 or 4-2.

*Conservative bets: Guessing the higher-ranked team would win a series.

For this analysis, I used the following Excel functions:

- IF
- SUMIF
- SUMIFS
- COUNTIF
- COUNTIFS
- VLOOKUP
- RIGHT
- LEN
- SEARCH
